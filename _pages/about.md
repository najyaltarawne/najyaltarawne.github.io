## Education
I am Najy AlTarawneh, a Computer Science student at the University of Houston with a minor in Mathematics and an expected graduation in Spring 2026. I have a strong passion for software engineering, web development, and database systems, and I enjoy solving complex problems that require logical thinking and clean, efficient solutions. Through my academic and project experience, I have developed solid skills in programming languages such as JavaScript, C++, and SQL, along with hands on experience in building full stack web applications using technologies like React and PostgreSQL. I have worked on enterprise style database and web application projects, focusing on system design, normalization, and data integrity, which strengthened my understanding of real-world software development practices. With a strong academic record and a 3.8+ GPA, I am highly motivated, quick to learn new technologies, and committed to writing maintainable, high quality code. I enjoy working in team environments, communicating ideas clearly, and continuously improving my technical and problem solving abilities. My goal is to grow into a professional software engineer who builds reliable, scalable, and impactful software solutions.
